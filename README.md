# Thamas' Game of Life!

"Real Life" may be the most expansive MMORPG out there, but in this zero player game, also known as [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Scholarly Reference"), you can create your own initial state, and then watch out it evolves!

Give it a try yourself [here](https://fantastic-rabanadas-850dc8.netlify.app/ "ABD - Always Be Deploying").

## Rules
In our world, we have many **cells** that, to _live_ must have their needs met.

Any cell may have up to eight neighbors, those that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

For each step through time in our world, a cell, whether living or _dead_ will be given new opportunity as such:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies of loneliness.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, due to extraneous extroversion.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, through ritualistic recall.
